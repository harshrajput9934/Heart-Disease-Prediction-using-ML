This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease using machine learning techniques.

## STEPS
- Imported essential libraries including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- Loaded the heart disease dataset and performed initial data exploration.
- Split the dataset into predictors and target variables.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand relationships between features and the target variable.
- Analyzed features such as sex, chest pain type, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, exercise-induced angina, and others.
- Implemented machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Network.
- Trained each model and evaluated their accuracy on the test set.
- Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy of 95.08%, followed by Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and XGBoost with accuracies around 85%.
- SVM and Decision Tree models had accuracies close to 82%, while the Neural Network model achieved an accuracy of 80.33%.
